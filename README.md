# KeyLogger-A keylogger is a program designed to record keyboard inputs in real-time. In this project, the keylogger captures key presses and releases, updating the user interface to reflect the current key state.

Key Features:
Key Press Detection: The program logs which key was pressed and displays it in a designated area on the webpage.
Key Release Detection: It also detects when a key is released and updates the log accordingly.
Start/Stop Functionality: Users can start and stop the keylogger using buttons, controlling when the program listens for key events.
